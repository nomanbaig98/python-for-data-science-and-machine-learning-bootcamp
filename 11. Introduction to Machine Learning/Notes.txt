Supervised Learning:

the learning in which we mould our inputs in accordance with correct output.

Example: Comparing spam with legitimate email


Classification error metrics:

Accuracy:
no. of correct predictions / total no. of predictions


Recall TP/ TP + FN


Precision TP/ TP + FP 



F1 score:
combination of recall and precision



Confusion matrix:

consider an example of model predicting disease

True Positive : patient has the disease and model predicting that it has the disease


True Negative : patient does'nt has the disease and model predicting that it does'nt has the disease


False Positive : patient does'nt has the disease and model predicting that it has the disease


False Negative : patient has the disease and model predicting that it does'nt has the disease



Regression error metrics:

Regression is when model predicts continuous values unlike categorical values (which is classification)
