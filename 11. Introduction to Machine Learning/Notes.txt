Supervised Learning:

the learning in which we mould our inputs in accordance with correct output.

Example: Comparing spam with legitimate email






Unsupervised Learning: 

models are trained using unlabeled dataset, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data.

Example: Customer Segmentation






Classification error metrics:

Accuracy:
no. of correct predictions / total no. of predictions


Recall TP/ TP + FN


Precision TP/ TP + FP 


F1 score:
combination of recall and precision






Confusion matrix:

consider an example of model predicting disease

True Positive : patient has the disease and model predicting that it has the disease


True Negative : patient does'nt has the disease and model predicting that it does'nt has the disease


False Positive : patient does'nt has the disease and model predicting that it has the disease


False Negative : patient has the disease and model predicting that it does'nt has the disease






Regression error metrics:

Regression is when model predicts continuous values unlike categorical values (which is classification)


Independent Variable (x) 
Dependent Variable (y)


ML models Usage:

Linear Regression:

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
Linear regression is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
Linear Regression can be used to generate insights on consumer behaviour, understanding business and factors influencing profitability. Linear regressions can be used in business to evaluate trends and make estimates or forecasts.
For example, if a companyâ€™s sales have increased steadily every month for the past few years, by conducting a linear analysis on the sales data with monthly sales, the company could forecast sales in future months.
